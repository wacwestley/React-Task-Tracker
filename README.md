React based task tracker app.
First use "npm run server" then also run "npm start".

This app uses React and various tools such as react router in very basic forms.
Also uses a small db.json backend to add and delete tasks from the app.

Clicking the Add button opens a form to add a task and if you want a reminder.
Reminders have a green line next to them and you can double click to remove
    the reminder.
Small example of React Router is used on the about link.
